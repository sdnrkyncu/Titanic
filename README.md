# Titanic

I started this project for the indivudial purpose of practising what I learn from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning" by Aurélien Géron 
on another dataset (titanic) different from the dataset used in the book. However, along the way I realized that this project could be 
useful also for others who want to learn machine learning. So, I decided to prepare it nicer firstly for myself for future refence, and for others. 


Some important features of the project:
1. The steps in the project follow the steps in the book, however do not cover all since different datasets require different editing.
2. In some points, I wanted to use different methods giving same result for solving one task. For example, in data cleaning step I wanted to show 
how to clean it with and without using pipelines. 

PS: the project has not yet ended.
